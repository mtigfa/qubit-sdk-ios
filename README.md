# Installation

## Cocoa Pods
Cocoa pods are a dependency management system for iOS. If you do not have cocoa pods configured, please read the installation documents on their website (https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). If you use another dependency management system, please contact us for alternative options. If you do not wish to implement one, please read "Using Framework Files" section.

Once you have cocoa pods installed, navigate to the Podfile in your app’s root directory. In the file, add the lines:

```
use_frameworks!

target :XXXXX do
    pod "QubitSDK", :git =>
    "https://github.com/qubitdigital/qubit-sdk-ios.git", :tag => "1.0.4"
end
```

where *XXXXX* is the name of your app target. Specify a GitHub *tag* to ensure you only opt-in to new releases of this SDK.

If you access the repo via SSH as opposed to HTTPS, the target URL will be *git@github.com:qubitdigital/qubit-sdk-ios.git*. Then, from your command line, run

```
pod install
```

If you encounter permission issues, ensure the GitHub username step has been successfully completed. Please consult the cocoapods documentation if you have any other issues with this step. If your process freezes on “Analysing dependencies”, try running *pod repo remove master*, *pod setup*, then *pod install* again.

## Usign Framework Files

If you want to use QubitSDK without a package manager, you can do so by adding QubitSDK.framework files to your project. We prepared two versions of the framework for each configuration build - debug and release. FrameworkDebug contains files needed to run the SDK on devices and simulators (arm64, arm7, i384, and x86_64 architectures). FrameworkRelease contains files only for device architectures (arm, arm7, arm64). 

To add QubitSDK to your project, open Xcode, and right-click on your project. Select "Add Files to <Your Project Name>". Select QubitSDK.framework and press Add. SDK will be added and linked to your project. Please refer to our two example projects - QubitSwiftFrameworkDebugExampleApp and QubitSwiftFrameworkReleaseExampleApp. 

## Starting the QubitSDK
Starting the QubitSDK with a tracking ID will allow us to correctly identify your data.  
When starting the SDK, you can specify the log level of the SDK.  This will determine the amount of logging the SDK will produce.
The log level options for Objective-C are: QBLogLevelDisabled, QBLogLevelError, QBLogLevelInfo, QBLogLevelDebug, QBLogLevelVerbose, QBLogLevelWarning
The log level options for Swift are: .disabled, .error, .info, .debug, .verbose, .warning

To start the QubitSDK (preferably in your AppDelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions) use the following method


```objective-c
#import "QubitSDK/QubitSDK.h"

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [QubitSDK startWithTrackingId: @"XXXXX" logLevel: QBLogLevelDisabled];
    return YES;
}
```

```swift
import QubitSDK

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    QubitSDK.start(withTrackingId: "XXXXX", logLevel: .disabled)
    return true
}
```

Here *XXXXX* is your Qubit Tracking ID, which is a unique string representing your account, and will have already been provided to you. If you haven’t received a tracking ID, or don’t know what yours is, please contact us.
Objective-C requires *QubitSDK/QubitSDK.h* to be declared as an import within the file.
Swift requires QubitSDK to be declared as an import within the file.

# Sending Events

Before you will be able to send events from inside the app, a config file will need to be generated by Qubit on S3.
Here are the settings that can be set in the config:

```javascript
- tracking_id
- endpoint
- configuration_reload_interval
- queue_timeout
- send_auto_view_events
- send_auto_interaction_events
- send_geo_data
- vertical
- property_id
- namespace
- disabled
```

To send an event, call the *sendEvent* method. The following example emits a “ecUser” event:

```objective-c
#import "QubitSDK/QubitSDK.h"

[QubitSDK sendEventWithType:@"ecUser" dictionary:userDictionary];
[QubitSDK sendEventWithType:@"ecUser" data:userJsonAsString];
```

```swift
import QubitSDK

QubitSDK.sendEvent(type: "ecUser", dictionary: userDictionary)
QubitSDK.sendEvent(type: "ecUser", data: userJsonAsString)
```

where userDictionary is of type NSDictionary in Objective-C, Dictionary in Swift, and takes the form:

```
{
  userId: "jsmith",
  currency: "USD",
  email: "jsmith@gmail.com",
  firstName: "John",
  firstSession: false,
  gender: "Mr",
  hasTransacted: true,
  lastName: "Smith",
  language: "en-gb",
  title: "Mr",
  username: "jsmith"
}
```

# Experiences
SDK contains methods to fetch Experiences. This can be achieved by:

Swift
```swift
// Fetch an experience by ID (143640 in this example)
// This is calling for live experiences only
QubitSDK.fetchExperiences(withIds: [143640], onSuccess: { (experiences) in
    if let exp = experiences.first {
        // list out the payload values
        print("Got experience - payload:")
        for (key, value) in exp.payload {
            print("\(key) -> \(value)")
        }
        // mark the experience as shown
        exp.shown()
    }
}, onError: { (error) in
    print("Got error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}, preview: false, ignoreSegments: false, variation: nil)
```

Objective-C
```objective-c
[QubitSDK fetchExperiencesWithIds:@[@1] onSuccess:^(NSArray<QBExperienceEntity *> * _Nonnull experiences) {
    QBExperienceEntity* firstEntity = experiences.firstObject;
    [firstEntity shown]; // make a POST call to the returned callback URL
} onError:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
    NSLog(@"%@", error.description);
} preview:false variation:false ignoreSegments:false];
```

Above call takes optional parameters like `preview`, `ignoreSegments` and `variation`.

# Placements
SDK contains methods to fetch placements. This can be achieved by:

Swift
```swift
// Fetch a placement by ID ("143640" in this example)
QubitSDK.getPlacement(withId: "143640", onSuccess: { (placement) in
    if let placement = placement {
        // list out the payload values
        print("Got placement - content:")
        print("placement content -> \(placement.content)")
        // mark the experience as shown
        placement.clickthrough()
        placement.impression()
    }
}, onError: { (error) in
    print("Got error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
})
There are optional paramaters: mode - "LIVE", "SAMPLE", PREVIEW" (defaults to "LIVE"), attributes, campaignId, experienceId.

```

Objective-C
```objective-c
[QubitSDK getPlacementWithId:@"123456" onSuccess:^(QBPlacementEntity *> * _Nonnull placement) {
    [placement clickthrough];
    [placement impression];
} onError:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
    NSLog(@"%@", error.description);
};
```

# Disabling Tracking
If you would like to disable tracking, use the following method.

```objective-c
#import "QubitSDK/QubitSDK.h"

[QubitSDK stopTracking];   
```

```swift
import QubitSDK

QubitSDK.stopTracking()
```

# Common Crypto Issue
if add QubitSDK and still have problem with "Missing required module 'CommonCrypto'" please run in terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
```
after installation please build project again
